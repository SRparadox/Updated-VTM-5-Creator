Repeated attacks can eventually break open the cocoon but the difficulty is similar to trying to break open a safe. ❖ Liquefy The Mortal Coil: The vampire's palms become covered with small barbs.

The user adds 1 dice to all physical rolls and can chose to activate up to 2 additional Flesh Works Effects (no additional Rouse Checks are needed). ❖ Bloodform: The Kindred's body liquefies into a blood red ichor.

The Kindred can now target others with Flesh Works as long as he touches the intended target. However, unless the target possesses metamorphose themselves, they take a point of Aggravated Damage as the effects manifest. ❖ Doppelgänger: The user can perfectly mimic the physical properties and vocal cords of an individual they drank from. Unlike other vampiric powers, which focus on tricking the mind, this ability outright physically alters the user to look like their targets perfect copy. The ability can be kept going at the end of each Scene if an additional Rouse Check is made. The user does not inherit any of the targets supernatural or physical qualities aside from their looks. ❖ Chiropteran Marauder: This ability works exactly like Horrid Form with the exception that the user can only chose 1 additional Flesh Work Effect, instead of 2, and grows massive wings granting them the ability of semi-flight.

The Kindred spills some of their blood onto a golden coin in a building they wish to affect in order to cast the ritual. If successful the Kindred can transform the appearance of the building (both inside and out) into that of an opulent palace, mansion or similar. The illusion is incredibly detailed and will change items in the interior as well. Cracked cups become crystal glasses, the broken-down car in the garage becomes a luxury limo and so on. These changes never actually extend to functionality however so a leaking cup will still leak even if it looks like a crystal glass, while the new luxury limo will not run. Furthermore, any item taken out of the house instantly loses its illusionary effects. Type: Ritual. Tag: Physical. Range & Targets: Targets a building (the size of the building should be limited to a large house before penalties are applied by the Storyteller). Cost: 1 Scene + 1 Rouse Check. Conditions: Must target the building the ritual takes place in. The user must possess the Mirror Masking power to use this ritual. Risk: Moderate.

Anyone other than the Kindred or those of their blood (including ghouls and blood bound servants) will become affected automatically. For each intruder a spectre that embodies the victims worse fear will manifest. These are not supernatural fears like fire for vampires (although the storyteller can make them such) but rather deep personal horror. The spectres also have a mind of their own and each intruder's individual spectre does not need to haunt them itself. In game terms the area becomes chaotically haunted, and all enemies suffer a 2 dice penalty to all their rolls while the effects last (although the storyteller is welcome to introduce other affects as well).

Fire feels hot, although it does not burn, screams can leave a ringing in one's ear but do not deafen the individual and so on. In game terms unlike normal illusions, which cease to have an effect on a target once they are identified as such, illusions cast by this ability cannot be ignored even if the target knows the illusions are not real. The illusions cast by this ability are also more solid and can inflict physical damage, although this is strictly limited to Superficial Damage at most (even if a Kindred is being targeted by illusionary flames, although it goes without saying that the sensation of pain will make the experience more believable).
