  <div style="font-size: 20px;">A 'Vampire: the Masquerade' 5th Edition Character Creator</div>
</h1>


Quickly and easily create characters for all World of Darkness splats & export to printable, editable PDFs.

The creator runs entirely in your browser, no files are sent to a server.

This is a comprehensive World of Darkness character creation tool designed as the perfect introduction for newcomers to the setting. Whether you're creating vampires, werewolves, or other supernatural beings, this streamlined interface makes it easy to build characters following the official rules. It's an excellent way to introduce someone to the rich world of darkness without overwhelming complexity. You can download your character into a printable PDF when you're done (PDF templates kindly provided by [Nerdbert](https://linktr.ee/nerdbert)) and also save it to a local JSON file that you can load into this web app to continue editing.
